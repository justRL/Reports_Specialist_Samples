# This sample list contains projects from classes I've taken in the past year. Each file contains notes describing the scenario they were used in.

# MySQL_Gender_Breakdown.CSV creates a visualization that provides a breakdown between the male and female employees working in the "company" each year, starting from 1990. This could later be transferred into Tableau to construct a better understanding of the companies growth.

# MySQL_Trigger.CSV could be used to protect data integrity when INSERTING data into a database. The trigger would run BEFORE INSERT ON employees so that any data entered would be checked if the hire date of an employee is higher than the current date.

# show-attackers.sh is a shell script that displays the number of failed login attempts by IP address and location. This could be used in a scenario were you need to quickly summarize failed login attempts. That way you can decide if an IP address needs to be blocked.
